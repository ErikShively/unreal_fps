# unreal_fps
Code from my time exploring the unreal engine in 2020 and in 2021. Each folder contains my work done in their own projects labeled per year. This includes some old logic and vector math that's easily very wrong. This is corrected in the Godot project.
IMPORTANT NOTE: This work is unfinished and mostly includes basic FPS movement and some movement state switches.
There are currently no plans to update this project, and a lot of my work has moved to the Godot engine. This repository exists to archive my old work.
